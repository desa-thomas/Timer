# Timer
Simple timer app I made as my first project with HTML and Javascript!
## Usage
  1. Open index.html with any browser
     
  2. Set how many hours, minutes, and seconds you want the timer to run for (the minimum timer is 1 second, and the maximum is 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds)
<div align="center"><image src="assets/Screenshot1.png" width = "700"></image></div> <br/>
     
  3. Click start
     
  4. Wait for the timer to finish, or click stop to end the timer early
  <div align="center"><image src="assets/Screenshot2.png" width = "700"></image></div> <br/>
    
  5. Once the timer is done the alarm will loop until you click stop
  <div align="center"><image src="assets/Screenshot3.png" width = "700"></image></div> <br/>

  6. Click stop to end the alarm and reset the timer
